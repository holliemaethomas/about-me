 <h1>A lovely little life</h1> 
 <p id="intro">As you learned in the guessing game my name is Hollie. 
   I currently live in the Tacoma area of Washington. My husband and I moved here from North Carolina in 2012. We have made the Pacific North West our home and are currently raising two boys.

   </ul>

 <p id="education">
  Over the years I have attended various trade schools to include: National Holistic Institute for Massage Therapy and Health Education; The United States Army, Human Intelligence; and now finally Code Fellows Coding Academy. Each different education brought me to where I am and molded me into the multifacted person I am now. 
 </p>
 <p id="goals">
   My short term goal is to complete the programs offered at Code Fellows up to 401, I have not decided which way I am going to go however, Python or .net seem to be where the employment fields are going. My long term goals are to get involved with companies developing education software for children, particulariliy programs that are interactive for both child and parent. Parenting and being involved in my childrens education is my passion.
